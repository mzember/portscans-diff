Add liferay vulnerability detection scripts to detect/vulnerabilities/liferay, if your script requires dependencies, please indicate.  Use format `<ticket>.py` as the file name, for example.

Your script can be in whatever language you're familiar with.  Currently python and sh are supported, but more can be added, just please let purple team know.

Commands to run:
* `./gradlew :detect:targets:hosts :detect:targets:http :detect:targets:liferay;`
* `./gradlew :detect:vulnerabilities:clean :detect:vulnerabilities:liferay;`
* `./gradlew :util:hostHostnames :detect:owners;`

For example,
```
$ ./gradlew :detect:targets:hosts :detect:targets:http :detect:targets:liferay;
