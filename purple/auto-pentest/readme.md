Add liferay vulnerability detection scripts to detect/vulnerabilities/liferay, if your script requires dependencies, please indicate.  Use format `<ticket>.py` as the file name, for example.

Your script can be in whatever language you're familiar with.  Currently python and sh are supported, but more can be added, just please let purple team know.

Commands to run:
* `./gradlew :detect:targets:hosts :detect:targets:http :detect:targets:liferay;`
* `./gradlew :detect:vulnerabilities:clean :detect:vulnerabilities:liferay;`
* `./gradlew :util:hostHostnames :detect:owners;`

For example,
```
$ ./gradlew :detect:targets:hosts :detect:targets:http :detect:targets:liferay;

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1m 28s
3 actionable tasks: 3 executed
$ ./gradlew :detect:vulnerabilities:clean :detect:vulnerabilities:liferay;

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 5m 20s
189 actionable tasks: 189 executed
$ ./gradlew :util:hostHostnames :detect:owners;

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1s
2 actionable tasks: 2 executed
```
Run a vuln against a host
* `./gradlew :detect:vulnerabilities:www.liferay.com:liferay:LSV-278;`

Run a vuln against all hosts
* `./gradlew :detect:vulnerabilities:LSV-278;`

Run all vulns against a host
* `./gradlew :detect:vulnerabilities:www.liferay.com;`

Run all vulns against all hosts
* `./gradlew :detect:vulnerabilities:liferay;`

Then, the owner-grouped host-vulnerabilities list will be in $rootDir/:detect:owners (the ':' might give you issues)
