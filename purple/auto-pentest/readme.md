## How to run

`./gradlew :detect:targets:hosts :detect:targets:http :detect:targets:liferay;`

`./gradlew :detect:vulnerabilities:clean :detect:vulnerabilities:liferay;`

`./gradlew :util:hostHostnames :detect:owners;`

## Requirements
PATH needs python, sh, curl, and nmap

python needs requests

## How to contribute

### Add a vulnerability detection
Drop in a .py or .sh in detect/vulnerabilities/<service>

### Add a service detection
Drop in a .py or .sh in detect/targets/<service>

If you want to write in something other than python or shell, let me know.

## Example run

```
$ ./gradlew :detect:targets:hosts :detect:targets:http :detect:targets:liferay;

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1m 28s
3 actionable tasks: 3 executed
$ ./gradlew :detect:vulnerabilities:clean :detect:vulnerabilities:liferay;

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 5m 20s
189 actionable tasks: 189 executed
$ ./gradlew :util:hostHostnames :detect:owners;

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1s
2 actionable tasks: 2 executed
```

### Different ways to run
Run a vuln against a host
* `./gradlew :detect:vulnerabilities:www.liferay.com:liferay:LSV-278;`

Run a vuln against all hosts
* `./gradlew :detect:vulnerabilities:LSV-278;`

Run all vulns against a host
* `./gradlew :detect:vulnerabilities:www.liferay.com;`

Run all vulns against all hosts
* `./gradlew :detect:vulnerabilities:liferay;`

Then, the owner-grouped host-vulnerabilities list will be in $rootDir/:detect:owners (the ':' might give you issues)
